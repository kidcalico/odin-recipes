        Kombucha is a tangy, lightly fizzy fermented tea that’s surprisingly easy to make at home. Using just tea, sugar, water, and a SCOBY (a living culture of bacteria and yeast), you can brew a refreshing drink that balances sweet and tart flavors while developing natural carbonation. The process is simple: brew sweet tea, add the SCOBY, and let time and fermentation do the work. In about a week, you’ll have your own homemade kombucha that can be enjoyed plain or flavored with fruit, herbs, or spices for a personalized twist.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 cups (1 gallon/~3.8 liters) water</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>8 black or green teabags <em>or</em> two tbsp loose tea</li>
        <li>1 SCOBY</li>
        <li>Large jar (capable of holding 4 quarts/3.8 liters)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Boil about 4 cups of water. Add tea bags and sugar, stir until sugar dissolves. Let it steep, covered, for 10-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove tea bags and pour sweet tea into a clean glass jar. Add the rest of the water to cool it down.
        </li>
        <li>
            When tea is room temperature, with clean hands, add SCOBY to the jar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the jar with a breathable cloth secured with a rubber band.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now the exciting part! Let it ferment at room temperature (68-85&#176;F or 18-29&#176;C) for 7-10 days, tasting periodically until it reaches your preferred balance of sweet and tart.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the SCOBY, placing it in a separate container to save it for the next batch. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a <em>clean</em> siphon or ladle and a funnel, add the fermented Kombucha into <em>clean</em> bottles. You can also add fruit, ginger or herbs to flavor. Be careful at first with super sweet fruit as it can cause over carbonation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Seal the bottles and let them sit in the dark for two or three days to carbonate. 
        </li>
    </ol>
