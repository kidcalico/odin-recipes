    <p>
        Kettle corn is a nostalgic treat that balances sweet and salty in every crunchy handful. This version gives it a wholesome twist by using coconut sugar instead of refined white sugar, adding a subtle caramel flavor that pairs beautifully with the popcorn&rsquo;s light crunch. Made on the stovetop with just a few pantry staples, it&rsquo;s quick, vegan, and healthier than most packaged snacksâ€”-perfect for movie nights or a sweet-savory pick-me-up.

    <!-- ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) popcorn kernels</li>
        <li>3 tbsp coconut oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (65g) coconut sugar</li>
        <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- cooking steps -->
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the coconut oil over medium-high heat. Drop in 2-3 kernels and cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>Once the test kernels pop, add the remaining popcorn kernels and sprinkle coconut sugar evenly over the top. Stir quickly to coat, then cover with the lid.</li>
        <li>Shake the pot gently every few seconds to keep the sugar from burning and to move unpopped kernels to the bottom.</li>
        <li>When popping lows to 1-2 seconds between pops, remove from heat. Immediately sprinkle with salt and give the pot a final shake.</li>
        <li>Allow popcorn to cool slightly before serving (it&rsquo;s hot!)</li>
    </ol>
